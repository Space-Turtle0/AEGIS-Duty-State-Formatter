# AEGIS-Duty-State-Formatter
*Using Github cause REPL doesn't want to work.*

[![Run on Repl.it](https://repl.it/badge/github/Space-Turtle0/AEGIS-Duty-State-Formatter)](https://repl.it/github/Space-Turtle0/AEGIS-Duty-State-Formatter)

**How do I use this?**
You can either use a free tool like REPL (Online IDE) or you can download a trusted IDE (App to run python) to run the formatter. If you are unsure what to do, just click the button above to run it in an online version!
I don't suggest downloading this and running it off of command prompt beacuse you don't need too, but if you want you can. 
The code is open to everyone so feel free to modify it or whatever you want to do. There isn't malware in this, you can look for yourself. 
Anyway, download the .py file and open it in your IDE, then run it. Follow the steps and at the end you should see a screen with your duty state you can copy.

**What does this do?**
For now it just checks the URL if its on the whitelisted domains list and also formats everything. I'll be adding other things to shorten the process soon.
