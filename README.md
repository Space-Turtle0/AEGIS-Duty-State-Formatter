# AEGIS-Duty-State-Formatter
*Using Github cause REPL doesn't want to work.*

[![Run on Repl.it](https://repl.it/badge/github/Space-Turtle0/AEGIS-Duty-State-Formatter)](https://repl.it/github/Space-Turtle0/AEGIS-Duty-State-Formatter)

**How do I use this?**
You can either use a free tool like REPL (Online IDE) or you can download a trusted IDE (App to run python) to run the formatter. 

If you are unsure what to do, just click the button above to run it in an online version!
Once you click it, you should see a box pop up in the top right of your screen. Select Python as the language. (Click Bash and select Python instead) Then for the run command, just paste this in the box: "python formatter.py". Once you do this click done and click the run button!


**What does this do?**
For now it just checks the URL if its on the whitelisted domains list and also formats everything. I'll be adding other things to shorten the process soon.
