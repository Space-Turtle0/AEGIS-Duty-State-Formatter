# AEGIS-Duty-State-Formatter
*Using Github cause REPL doesn't want to work.*

**How do I use this?**
You can either use a free tool like REPL (Online IDE) or you can download a trusted IDE (App to run python) to run the formatter.
I don't suggest downloading this and running it off of command prompt beacuse you don't need too, but if you want you can. 
The code is open to everyone so feel free to modify it or whatever there isn't malware in this. Look for yourself. 
Anyway, download the .py file and open it in your IDE, then run it. Follow the steps and at the end you should see a screen with your duty state you can copy.
